// Package natattach loads the compiled NAT66 XDP program and attaches it to
// one interface, a shard's fabric-facing uplink.
//
// It mirrors the edge attach package's mechanics almost verbatim: pinned maps,
// verifier-error unwrapping, incompatible-map recreation on a schema change, and
// native-driver-mode attach with no generic-mode fallback. See that package for
// the rationale behind each, which applies here unchanged.
//
// # No kernel preflight check
//
// Unlike its sibling, Load runs no preflight check first. The edge preflight
// package is scoped to that datapath's own map types, which do not include the
// LRU hash this connection table uses, and the uSID preflight package is scoped
// to the TC-BPF datapath. Neither fits, and a third package is out of scope for
// now. Loading already surfaces "this kernel cannot load this program" clearly,
// just later than a dedicated check would.
//
// # One attach target, no re-attachment
//
// This program has exactly one target, a fixed operator-configured interface,
// attached once at process startup. There is no external event this package
// needs to notice on its own.
